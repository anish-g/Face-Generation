# Face Generation

This project is part of Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.  
The goal of this project is to define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces and to get a generator network to generate _new_ images of faces that look as realistic as possible.


__Note:__ The model takes a long time as the dataset is large so train in GPU or cloud services that provide GPU like Google Colab etc if possible. 

### Dataset
[CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

### Frameworks
